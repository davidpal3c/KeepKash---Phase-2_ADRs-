# ADR - Navigation Strategy 

<br>
## Status: 
Accepted 

 <br>

## Context: 
While developing our mobile expense manager app we have decided the following regarding the navigation strategy for the app. The app's navigation is an important aspect of the user experience, and we want to ensure it is intuitive, user-friendly and consistent across both iOS and Android platforms. The current situation is that we have multiple ideas on how to structure the navigation, but we find tab-based navigation to be a good start. We think the following navigation strategy is best. 

 
<br>
## Solution: 
We will go with a tab-based navigation system for my mobile password manager application. This approach provides several advantages: 

 

--> Consistency: 
Tab-based navigation is a widely accepted and familiar pattern for mobile applications on both iOS and Android. Users will find it easy to navigate as they are already accustomed to it. 

 

--> Efficiency: 
Tabs allow users to switch between primary sections of the app (e.g., Passwords, Settings, Security) quickly, reducing the number of taps required to access essential features. 

 

--> Discoverability: 
Users can easily see the primary functions of the app, making it easier for them to find what they need. It also simplifies the onboarding process for new users. 

 

--> Scalability: 
Tab-based navigation can accommodate future additions to the app's functionality while maintaining a clean and organized user interface.

## Consequences 

The adoption of a tab-based navigation strategy will have the following consequences: 

 

--> Easier to Navigate: 

Users will find the app easier to navigate, reducing the learning curve and improving the overall user experience. 

The development team will benefit from the standardization of navigation elements, simplifying development and maintenance. 

 

--> Consistency Across Platforms: 

The app will offer a consistent navigation experience on both iOS and Android devices, enhancing the perception of quality and usability. 

 

--> Increased Development Time: 

Implementing tab-based navigation may require more development time initially compared to other strategies. 

There may be challenges in creating custom tabs to match the app's design and branding. 

 

--> User Feedback: 

User feedback will be necessary to refine the placement and labeling of tabs for optimal user satisfaction. Iterative improvements may be required.
