# ADR â€“ Development Framework 

<br>
## Status: 
Accepted  

<br>
 

## Context: 
We are in the early stages of developing a mobile application, and one of the key architectural decisions to be made is the selection of a development framework. The framework plays an important role in defining the look and feel of the application and impacts the development process, maintenance, and the user experience.  

 
<br>

## Solution: 
We are using the React Native Elements UI toolkit for the following reasons: 

 

--> Popularity and Community Support: 
React Native Elements has a large and active community, which means that it is more likely to receive ongoing support and updates. It has a substantial number of contributors and is widely adopted within the React Native community. 

 

--> Rich Component Library: 
React Native Elements provides a comprehensive set of UI components, including buttons, navigation bars, input fields and more. These align with the Material Design guidelines. This rich library will expedite our development process. 

 

--> Customization: It offers the flexibility to customize the look and feel of components, allowing us to maintain our brand identity while following the best design practices. 

 

--> Consistency: React Native Elements aims to provide consistent design and functionality across different platforms, ensuring a uniform user experience. 

 

--> Extensibility: The toolkit is extensible and can easily integrate third-party libraries or custom components to meet our unique requirements.
